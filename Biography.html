          <p> Robert Metcalfe was born in Brooklyn, New York, April 7th 1946. He is 75 Years old, 
              and 76 in two weeks. He is an engineer and entrepreneur who was trained 
              in MIT-Harvard University and later helped pioneer the Internet in 1970. 
              His mentor was none other than Steve Jobs. Metcalfe co-invented the Ethernet, 
              which enabled the networking of computers, while at Xerox PARC in 1973.

          </p>
          <p>Metcalfe later co-founds 3Com, (a company that went public in 1984) which 
              provides computer network products such as network interface controllers, 
              switches, routers, wireless access points, ip voice systems, and intrusion 
              detection systems, which relates to cybersecurity. Bob Metcalfe is now, and 
              I think to this day, a Professor of Innovation at the University of Texas at 
              Austin.</p>

          <p> He once said that, “The world needs a better understanding of how to encourage 
              innovation. And innovators need to get better at it. Sign me up.” He’s actually 
              pretty funny, and uses satire to keep his interviews interesting. While he is 
              renowned for his expertise and contributions to advocating the use of Ethernet, 
              Metcalfe is notorious for his famously incorrect predictions. He said, and I quote, 
              “The internet will catastrophically collapse in 1996.” He’s pretty funny, but I think 
              he was serious on that one.</p>
